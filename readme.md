# Create a Study Planner from a YouTube Playlist

Studying for exams can be a daunting task, especially when you're not sure where to start. This Python script simplifies the process by organizing the study sessions for you. It takes a YouTube playlist URL and isolates 1 hour of video content for you to watch each day. This way, you can focus your energy on what needs to be done rather than when you need to do it.

## Example Use Case

Consider **Professor Messer's "How to Pass Your N10-008 Network+ Exam"** YouTube playlist. This is a playlist of 93 informative videos ranging from 3-21 minutes per video. Using this script, you can structure a study plan to complete his comprehensive course in just 16 days, at only 1 hour per day.
