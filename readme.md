# YouTube Playlist Study Scheduler

Studying for exams can be a daunting task, especially when you're not sure where to start. This Python script simplifies the process by organizing your study sessions. It takes a YouTube playlist URL and schedules 1 hour of video content for you to watch each day. This way, you can focus on learning without the stress of planning.

## Example Use Case

Consider **Professor Messer's "How to Pass Your N10-008 Network+ Exam"** YouTube playlist. Using this script, you can structure your study plan to complete his comprehensive course in just 16 days, dedicating only 1 hour per day.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python and `yt-dlp` installed on your system. If you don't know how to do this, reddit is a great resource. 
2. **Running the Script**: Execute the script by providing the YouTube playlist URL when prompted.
3. **Input the Start Date**: Specify your desired start date for the study schedule in MM/DD/YYYY format.
4. **Review Your Schedule**: The script will output a `.txt` file named after the playlist, containing your personalized study schedule.

## Final Remarks

Good Luck!
